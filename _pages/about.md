I am a PhD economics student at the [University of Washington](https://econ.washington.edu/people/erik-andersen){:target="_blank"}, mainly interested in applied econometrics, causal inference and mircoeconomic theory with a focus on environmental economics. This is a place to share my research and blog posts.
